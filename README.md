 **A Prediction Tool for Profitability in Real Estate**

## Introduction

In today's dynamic real estate landscape, staying ahead of the curve requires innovation and efficiency. As the industry continues to evolve, so do the demands and expectations of both clients and professionals. Recognizing this need for adaptability and optimization, we propose the development and implementation of cutting-edge prediction software tailored specifically for real estate businesses â€“ a tool that not only streamlines operations but also enhances strategic decision-making and maximizes commission opportunities.

The real estate sector operates within a fast-paced environment, characterized by calculated investments, timely returns, and multifaceted market dynamics. Yet, despite the industry's complexity, many businesses still rely on outdated systems and manual processes to project and calculate profit, leading to inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and decreased competition.

The main function of our software is to predict whether there will be a profit for a given prospective property considering attributes such as number of bedrooms and baths, square footage of home, acreage, and zip code. After a prediction has been made, HomePrice Pro provides suggestions based on the result of the prediction with its goal to increase profits. Given the goal, HomePrice Pro aims to address the challenge of determining a profit regarding developing or investing in a property to upgrade and sell back on the market.

Our strategic objective is to enable real estate enterprises with the tools to undergo developmental plans with confidence in their capability to profit. This in turn will propel business and increase their profit margin.

## User Requirements

The HomePrice Pro software works with the developer in the planning process with its main function being its ability to determine if a potential real estate project is profitable. To determine this, the system shall be trained to make an accurate profit/non-profit prediction utilizing the USA Real Estate dataset and then it shall provide a minimum of 10 similar listings from the dataset based on the user input. This is the most critical aspect of the software as it allows our users to determine if their current project should move into production, saving time and money. Without it, the user could potentially be wasting resources.

The software shall then provide the user with suggestions of possible layouts and price points that are currently on the market. Considering the current market is an important aspect of this software as it provides users the ability to compete and profit. Without the knowledge, the user could spend over 30 days on the market resulting in a long wait time on their return on investment. Whether or not there is a profit, the software shall make a suggestion to increase profits.

Lastly, the software shall provide the users with a property comparison tool that enables them to compare multiple properties side by side. This is a fundamental function as it saves the user time in facilitating informed decision-making and market analysis. Development projects are both costly and time-sensitive, providing this function to be beneficial.
